      <H1> WHAT IS FFMPEG? BRIEF DISCUSSION </H1>
      <p> ffmpeg is a very fast video and audio converter that can also grab from a live audio/video source. It can also convert between arbitrary sample rates and resize video on the fly with a high quality polyphase filter.

   ffmpeg reads from an arbitrary number of input "files" (which can be regular files, pipes, network streams, grabbing devices, etc.), specified by the "-i" option, and writes to an arbitrary number of output "files", which are specified by a plain output url. Anything found on the command line which cannot be interpreted as an option is considered to be an output url.

Each input or output url can, in principle, contain any number of streams of different types (video/audio/subtitle/attachment/data). The allowed number and/or types of streams may be limited by the container format. 
Selecting which streams from which inputs will go into which output is either done automatically or with the "-map" option (see the Stream selection chapter).

   To refer to input files in options, you must use their indices (0-based). E.g.  the first input file is 0, the second is 1, etc.
 Similarly, streams within a file are referred to by their indices. E.g. "2:3" refers to the fourth stream in the third input file. Also see the Stream specifiers chapter.

   As a general rule, options are applied to
   the next specified file. Therefore, order is
   important, and you can have the same option
   on the command line multiple times. Each
   occurrence is then applied to the next input
   or output file.  Exceptions from this rule
   are the global options (e.g. verbosity
   level), which should be specified first.

   Do not mix input and output files -- first
   specify all input files, then all output
   files. Also do not mix options which belong
   to different files. All options apply ONLY
   to the next input or output file and are
   reset between files. </p>
